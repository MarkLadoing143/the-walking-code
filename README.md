## Description
Developed using Java with the [BlueJ Development Enviroment](https://www.bluej.org/), this University Java Development Assignment is a text-based "dungeon crawler"-style game where the player has to navigate a grid-like map to find the exit point, all while trying to avoid zombies which move randomly and kill in one-hit. The game is played from a top-down perspective with controls entered using single-key commands.
