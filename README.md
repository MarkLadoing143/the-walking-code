# The Walking Code: Zombie Escape Edition
Originally Developed from March to April 2014 for COMP 1502 - Programming II: Object Oriented Programming at Mount Royal University with base code provided by the course instructor. Additional Information about this assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/MarkLadoing143/the-walking-code/blob/master/Assignment%205.pdf).

## Description
Developed using Java with the [BlueJ Development Enviroment](https://www.bluej.org/), this University Java Development Assignment is a text-based "dungeon crawler"-style game where the player has to navigate a grid-like map to find the exit point, all while trying to avoid zombies which move randomly and kill in one-hit. The game is played from a top-down perspective with controls entered using single-key commands. Users also have the ability to select the type of "overworld" they wish to play in by entering the name of one of the various text files used to construct it stored in the "input" folder.
